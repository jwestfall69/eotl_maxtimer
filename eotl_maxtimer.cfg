// This config allows overriding the global eotl_maxtimer_time convar for specific
// control points on specific maps.  Be mindful this plugin taps into the time add
// event and not the actually control points being captured, but still refers to
// stuff as control points.
//
// Multi-stage maps are supported.  When a mini round ends the plugins won't reset
// the control point number and will instead continue to count up where it left off
// from the previous stage.  ie: if stage #1 has 3 control points, when you goto
// stage #2 it's first control point will be considered cp4.  The final capture point
// that ends a stage does not count to the control point number (since it doesn't add
// any time).
//
// If you are unsure which cp# value to use, it's included when the plugins says the max
// time was applied in chat
//
// ie: [maxtimer] adjusting remaining round time from 596.1 seconds to 315.0 seconds [cp3] [G]
//
// Additionally the last [x] indicates if the max time came from the global [G]
// eotl_maxtimer_time convar or an override [O]

		// control point.  Multiple cp# lines are allowed for a map.
